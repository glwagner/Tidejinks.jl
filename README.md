`Tidejinks` uses data generated by NASA's
[Navigation and Ancillary Information Facility](https://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif/about.html)
via the [`SPICE.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaAstro/SPICE.jl) wrapper around NASA's
[Spice toolkit]([https://github.com/JuliaAstro/SPICE.jl](https://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif/index.html))
An Nguyen and Joern Callies wrote precursor code to Tidejinks and helped with configuring the NAIF kernels.
